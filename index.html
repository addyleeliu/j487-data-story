      <h1>Growing evidence for climate change has brought
        shifts in perceived responsibility</h1>

      <p>Ranked as the second hottest year in recorded history, 2017 continued a long-term global warming trend, NASA reported at the start of 2018.</p>
      <p>Though the Earth's climate has fluctuated throughout history due to variations in the planet's orbit, the last century has seen a sudden and unusually fast rise in Earth's temperature.</p>
      <p>The chart below shows the global land and ocean temperature anomalies over a 138-year period. When studying climate change, temperature anomalies provide a more accurate picture than absolute temperature, which can vary drastically depending on the location and elevation of the measuring station.</p>

      <p>This chart reveals a widening gap between current and baseline global temperatures.</p>
      <p>Scientists have long predicted widespread, catastrophic consequences of this global warming, including more frequent hurricanes, rising sea levels, coastal flooding, and severe droughts in warmer areas, among other changes in weather patterns.</p>
      <p>As the evidence for global warming has become increasingly undeniable, perceptions about responsibility - who is responsible, and what they are responsible for - have changed.</p>

      <h2>The Usual Suspects</h2>

      <p>The dawn of the Industrial Age ushered in huge advancements in technology and manufacturing processes. However, these advancements, which came in the form of factories, power plants, and cars, necessitated the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal, a process that releases large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat, leading to global warming.</p>
      <p>Climate change studies have typically focused on a number of countries and economic sectors that are notorious for contributing significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

      <br><br>

      <h2>Drilling Down Into Responsibility</h2>

      <p>A group called the Carbon Disclosure Project is now pointing the finger at 100 specific fossil fuel producers, who they claim are responsible for 71% of all global emissions.</p>

      <h1>Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Producer (Cumulative 1988-2015)</h1>
      <table id="ajax-table" class="display" style="width:100%">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Producer</th>
                <th>% Contributed to Operational and Product-Related Global Industrial Greenhouse Gas Emissions</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
      </table>

      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <p>More nuanced portraits of the greatest contributors to global emissions have led to changing opinions about responsibility. New information about the enormous corporate and national players in the global problem of climate change is now raising questions about individual responsibility.</p>
